# NCIX2016-QRcode

NCIX.com is running a contest where they state they've hidden 20 QR Codes inside their videos. This tool simply scrapes the latest uploaded video and searches for QR Codes by exporting one frame per second. It's relatively slow to run on my machine, however there are likely not that many videos.


##Codes from Videos

The Screenshots are located in the images folder, however for convenience the codes are located below:

* 6DA38 - [2016-11-21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bgXI3BALL8)
* 4969D - [2016-11-21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bgXI3BALL8)

**2/20 Codes found, three videos scraped.**
